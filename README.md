# About the application
## Social media
**Welcome to the social media application!**
The social media application is a kind of prototype of a vk website. There you can find new friends,
keep in touch with them, edit your profile data, share your posts and etc. The app was written to provide 
the user with the ability to relax and spend his/her free time chilling or chatting with someone else.

(Most of the app was written according to the youtube video course based on class components which are not
relevant nowadays)
P.S. that was my first project therefore don't judge strictly:)
